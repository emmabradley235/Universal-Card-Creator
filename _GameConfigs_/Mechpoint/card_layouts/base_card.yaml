# Each card layout has the following fields:
# - InheritFrom (str of another card layout's name, or None) - If inheriting from another layout, card creator will make that layout
#     except adding any elements from this layout (or overwriting elements with the same name).
# - UseIf (dict of conditions) - Each condition must be met to use this card layout. To be used, all conditions from a layout (and layouts it inherits from) must be met.
# - Elements (dict of card elements)

# Each card element has the folowing fields:
# - Layer (int) - Elements with lower layer values are drawn first. 
# - Type (string) - Determines how the card creator handles this element and what parameters it expects.
# - Width (float) - Percentage of the card's X size that the element's width should be.
# - Height (float) - Percentage of the card's Y size that the element's height should be.
# - Location (2 floats in a list, [x, y]) - Percentages used to place the element's origin point. Note: +x is right, +y is down.
# - OriginSide (2 strings in a list, [Left/Center/Right, Top/Center/Bottom]) - Where on the element the origin should be located.
#     Default: [Center, Center]

# Types of Card Elements (and their unique fields):
# - Textbox:
#   - FillFrom (str, name of a card field) - Which card field to use to fill the textbox.
#   - Font (str, name of an imported font) - Default textbox font.
#   - FontSize (int) - How big to make the font be for this textbox.
#   - MaxWidth (float, str with val "Width", or None) - If float, percentage max. If "Width", doesn't allow width expansion. If None, will go up to card with.
#   - MaxHeight (float, str with val "Width", or None) - If float, percentage max. If "Height", doesn't allow width expansion. If None, will go up to card height. 
#   - BackgroundImgElement: (Dict of parameters, or None)
#     - LocationOffset (2 floats in a list, [x, y]) - Offset from the textbox's origin.
#     - WidthOffset (float) - How much wider (or narrower if negative) the background img is than the textbox.
#     - HeightOffset (float) - How much taller (or shorter if negative) the background img is than the textbox.
#     - ImageAsset (path to the relevant img within "frame_elements") - Image asset to use for the textbox background.
# - Image:
#   - ImageAsset (path to the relevant img within "frame_elements") - Image asset to use for this element (will be stretched to element dimensions).
# - DynamicImg:
#   - DefaultImageAsset (path to the relevant img within "frame_elements") - Image asset to use for this element if no element conditions are met.
#   - ImageAssetOptions (dict with keys being image paths and values being conditions) - Picks the most restrictive condition met and uses the associated image.
# - UserImage:
#   - ImportButtonText (str) - The text used for the image import button in the UI.
